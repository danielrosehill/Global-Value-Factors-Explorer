| Parameter | Definition                                                                                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PM2.5     | Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers. PM2.5 can penetrate deep into the lungs and has significant health impacts.|
| SOx       | Sulfur oxides, a group of compounds containing sulfur and oxygen, primarily released from burning fossil fuels. They contribute to acid rain and respiratory problems.|
| NH3       | Ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen, often released from agricultural activities and fertilizers. High concentrations can affect air quality and health.|
| PM10      | Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers. PM10 particles can enter the respiratory system and cause various health issues.|
| NOx       | Nitrogen oxides, a group of gases including nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NOâ‚‚), typically produced from vehicle emissions and industrial processes. NOx contributes to smog and acid rain.|
| VOC       | Volatile Organic Compounds, a group of organic chemicals that can easily vaporize into the air, often emitted from vehicle exhaust, paints, and solvents. VOCs can contribute to ground-level ozone formation and smog.|
